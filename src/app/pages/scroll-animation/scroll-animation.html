					<h1>Mandate of the Inquisition</h1>
					<p class="subtitle">
						By decree of the Digital Inquisition, flat and lifeless interfaces are
						hereby condemned. Every scroll, every cursor move, every fragment of
						light in this scene must serve one purpose — to judge, transform and
						elevate the experience.
					</p>
					<p>
						This portfolio is not a gallery. It is a trial ground where ideas,
						interfaces and animations are tested by motion, depth and light. Three.js
						is the sanctioned weapon; GSAP is the liturgy that binds frames into
						ritual.

					<h2>Edicts of Motion & Geometry</h2>
					<p>
						Each object in the background is a sigil of control — torus, cone and
						knot bound to scroll and parallax. They respond not as decoration, but
						as proof that the interface listens, reacts and obeys.
					</p>
					<p>
						When I build WebGL experiences, I treat every scene as a chapel of
						interaction: camera paths become processions, shader graphs become
						incantations, and UI elements orbit around a single truth — clarity in
						the middle of controlled chaos.

						<li>Scroll-linked 3D storytelling for products and portfolios.</li>
						<li>Angular + Three.js interfaces where UI and WebGL live as one.</li>
						<li>Custom shaders that feel like relics — glowing, worn, battle-tested.</li>

					<h2>Commission a new investigation</h2>
					<p>
						If your project demands more than another template and a hero section,
						it belongs here. I design experiences where the first scroll already
						tells a story, and the last frame still echoes in the user’s memory.
					</p>
					<p>
						We can forge an interactive case study, a product walkthrough, a
						scroll-driven narrative or a full 3D brand world where your users don’t
						just read about value — they <em>feel</em> it in motion, light and
						space.
